  <p>In Lizard Quest, you play as a lizard-owning kindergardener, who has to defend his lizard's honor. Send your lizard into battles against the other lizards of the playground - including those of both the domestic and the wild variety - and defeat the toughest lizard on the playground to be the best lizard trainer there is!</p>
  <p>You'll also find that the playground has a lot to offer. Visit many of the unique locals, like the jungle-gym, the sand box, or Liz's Lemonade Stand! These spots - placed along the perimeter of the map - are where you'll find the five boss battles of the game. These battles won't be easy, so be sure to stock up on cookies.

You can also heal during your turn, using cookies collected in the overworld. But don't indulge too often, or you'll have no way to heal.</p>
