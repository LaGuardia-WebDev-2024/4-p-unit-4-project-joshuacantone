  <p>You'll also find that the playground has a lot to offer. Visit many of the unique locals, like the jungle-gym, the sand box, or Liz's Lemonade Stand! These spots - placed along the perimeter of the map - are where you'll find the five boss battles of the game. These battles won't be easy, so be sure to stock up on cookies.

  <h2>Gameplay</h2>

  <p>Explore the expansive overworld that is the playground! You can talk to NPCs - which will que diologue and sometimes lead to a battle - or fight lizards to level up. When entering a battle, you'll find you have a few options. Battling will deduct health from the opponent, and will then proceed to their turn. You can also heal during your turn, using cookies collected in the overworld. But don't indulge too often, or you'll have no way to heal.</p>
